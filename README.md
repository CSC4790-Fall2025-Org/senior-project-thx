# Thx! – A Student-to-Student Service Marketplace

## 📖 Introduction
**Thx!** is a mobile app where students can list, discover, and book services offered by their peers on campus including haircuts, nail appointments, tailoring, tutoring, and more.  

Many students have unique skills and side hustles, but there’s no central place for others to find them. Thx! solves this by providing a trusted peer-to-peer marketplace that supports student entrepreneurship while making it easier for clients to connect with the right service.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Create a **central hub** for student-run services.  
- Help students **reach a wider audience** for their side hustles.  
- Make it simple for clients to **search, filter, and book services**.  
- Encourage a supportive **student-to-student economy** on campus.  

## ✨ Key Features
- 📝 **Service Listings** – Students can create and manage service profiles.  
- 🔎 **Search & Filtering** – Browse by service category.
- 📅 **Booking System** – Built-in scheduling for smooth appointments.  
- 👤 **User Profiles** – Manage activity as a service provider or client.  
- 🤝 **Peer Marketplace** – Campus-first, designed for trust and accessibility.
